Title: Gender differences in digital self-efficacy at school across 52 countries. 

Abstract: Despite the widespread integration of technology in classroom instruction and general exposition to it, significant gender disparities persist in technology’s agency, understood as a person’s confidence in their capacity to handle challenges and achieve desired outcomes for using technology. The self-efficacy to use digital technologies has proven to be a key aspect in the exercise of digital competencies, becoming essential for an adequate exercise of digital skills. Literature distinguished two dimensions of understanding self-efficacy: on the one hand, those oriented to the use of basic or general applications and those oriented to the use of advanced technological applications.

Using data from PISA 2022 (OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment), in which 307,425 students from 52 countries answered a module about information and communication technologies - ICT, this paper first proposes to assess self-efficacy's dimensionality considering the two constructs mentioned above. Second, to analyse gender disparities in both types of self-efficacy. And third, to analyse the variations between the countries participating in the study.

First, preliminary results show that it is possible to empirically distinguish the two dimensions across the countries evaluated: basic’s digital self-efficacy and advanced or specialized digital self-efficacy. In global terms, a higher level of general self-efficacy than specific self-efficacy can be observed. Consistent with previous evidence, women show higher levels of general self-efficacy and at the same time, lower levels of specialized self-efficacy compared to their gender counterparts. These results show relevant variations between countries.
